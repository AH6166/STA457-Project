# STA457-Final-Project
The report presents our approach to model cocoa futures prices with datasets: International Cocoa Organization (ICCO) and climate data (temperature and precipitation) from Ghana.
Overview
This project aims to model and analyze the price dynamics of cocoa futures using statistical methods and R. Our goal is to construct a well-structured report that clearly presents our modelling approach, results, and insights into factors influencing cocoa futures.

# Objectives
Explore and preprocess historical cocoa futures price data.

Identify trends, seasonality, and volatility patterns.

Apply statistical and time series modelling techniques.

Evaluate model performance and forecast future prices.

Interpret findings in the context of global cocoa markets.

# Tools & Technologies
